          <p>Replacing missing teeth is important for restoring your self-esteem. Getting rid of damaged teeth protects oral health and overall health. The best missing tooth replacement is a dental implant. Also it can restore single, multiple, or entire arches of teeth. Your new teeth provide you with the ability to eat and talk with complete confidence.</p>
          <p class="span">We use the newest and most advanced dental equipment available on the market in USA. We use top quality medical grade titanium or titanium alloy. These are the same materials used for other bone implants and orthopedic joint replacements. See the <a href="#">difference between titanium and zirconia dental implants</a>.<img src="img/porfile/pin.png" alt=""></p>
          <p>Our office is conveniently located in the heart of Sheepshead Bay at <a href="#">2579 East 17th street, Suite #11, Brooklyn, NY 11235</a>.

            <h5>Dental Implant Procedures in Brooklyn</h5>
            <p>LuxDen Dental Center offers a wide choice of dental procedures. These include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="#">Dentures or teeth in a day</a></li>
              <li><a href="#">Teeth in one hour</a></li>

              <li><a href="#">Denture implants</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="span"><a href="#">Immediate implant placement</a> is possible. We can remove a failing tooth and replace it with a dental implant the same day. Or the dental implant is “loaded” and a replacement tooth is fitted after surgery.
            <img src="img/porfile/pin.png" alt=""></p>
            <p>If this isn’t possible, Dr. Umanoff can fit you with a temporary tooth. This allows you to smile, talk, and eat during the healing process. Once healing is complete, your permanent teeth replace the temporary teeth. Your new teeth look and feel more attractive and natural.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="dental-function">
            <h5>What Are Dental Implants?</h5>
            <p>Dental implants are designed to replace damaged or missing teeth. Your new teeth are made of medical-grade titanium posts. They are surgically inserted into the jawbone. The posts replicate real tooth roots and are designed to fuse with the surrounding bone. The ability to fuse ensures implants are strong, stable, and can support a dental crown, bridge, or denture.</p>
            <p>Replacing missing teeth with implants will provide you with the ability to smile, chew your food, and speak with confidence. Read more about <a href="#">dental implants and their function</a></p>

            <h5>Advanced Dental Implant Solutions</h5>
            <p>Dr. Umanoff’s extensive experience and training allow him to use a wide range of dental implant systems. These include mini and zirconia dental implants. Patients benefit from receiving the best implant system for their needs.</p>
            <p>Dentists with less experience and training are only able to use one or two different dental implant systems. These specialists will try to adapt these systems to fit their patient’s needs. Dr. Umanoff chooses the most appropriate implant system for each patient.</p>
            <p>Experience and skill are important in planning and placing dental implants. Your new teeth must be situated correctly to ensure excellent functionality and appearance. This isn’t always straightforward. Dentists with less skill or who do not use appropriate technology may place a dental implant inappropriately. This achieves a less desirable result for the patient.</p>

            <h5>Latest Diagnostic Methods for Dental Implants</h5>
            <p>The most effective dental implant treatments require extensive planning behind the scenes. With advanced technologies this is possible.</p>
            <a href="#">3-D imaging system</a>
            <p>Our dental office has a 3D imaging system. We use it to take a detailed 3D scan of your jaws. The scan provides essential information when planning and placing your implants. Staying on top of new technology eliminates room for error during surgery.</p>

            <h5>Planning Software for Dental Implants</h5>
            <p>From dental scanning and planning to drilling and implant placement, the software offers us a comprehensive 3D system for accurate and predictable implant treatment. Blue Sky Plan is an advanced treatment planning software for computer guided surgery. Dr. Umanoff uses this software to 3D print surgical guides and models to replicate virtual plans.</p>

            <p>It is an approach that ensures your implant treatment is faster and minimally invasive. Your healing is quicker and smoother than ever before.</p>

          <div class="multiple-implants">
            <h5>What Are the Types of Dental Implants?</h5>
            <p>Much like other dental appliances, there are many types of dental implants available at our dental clinic. Our professional dental team will evaluate your oral health and determine the best type of implant for you. Crowns can come in different materials such as Porcelain Fused Zirconium, all-Ceramic, Porcelain Fused Metal, or Noble Metal. Dr. Umanoff uses his vast knowledge and experience to select the best material for your treatment.</p>
            <h5>Single Crown Dental Implants</h5>
            <p>We make implants to look and act like your natural teeth. This is how we offer our patients a worry-free solution with long-lasting results. We prepare the site for the implant using a virtual mock-up of your jaw to ensure accuracy. Once the implant is integrated, we use a custom or prefabricated abutment to create a mount for the crown.</p>
            <h5>How is Full Mouth Reconstruction Using Implants Done?</h5>
            <p>Full mouth reconstruction refers to rebuilding or replacing all the teeth in a patient’s mouth. <a href="#">Full mouth reconstructions</a> combine aesthetics with the science of restorative dentistry. Reconstructing your teeth improves the health, function, and beauty of your mouth. Dr. Umanoff specializes in cases where extensive dental work is required. This means that every step will be completed by Dr. Umanoff. He is your doctor from bone grafting and implant placement to final restoration. He plans your treatment to bring back your beautiful smile, restore your confidence, and your overall quality of life.</p>
            <h5>What are the Advantages of Dental Implants?</h5>
            <p>Dental implants are a great alternative to bridges or dentures to fill gaps where there are missing teeth. An advantage is that there are no required adjacent teeth that need to be prepared to hold the new replacement teeth in place. Tooth implants are much more comfortable than other dental appliances.</p>
            <h5>Am I Suitable for Dental Implants?</h5>
            <p>Your first visit to LuxDen Dental Center includes an implant consultation. Dr. Umanoff will review your dental and medical history. He will discuss treatment in more detail, including possible pros and cons.</p>
            <h5>Am I Suitable for Dental Implants?</h5>
            <p><strong>Most people are suitable for replacing missing teeth with implants</strong>. You must have good oral and overall health. Good health is a requirement for the small surgical procedure. It is essential to have healthy gums and be free from periodontal disease. Tooth implants need strong support from a healthy jawbone as they fuse with this bone.</p>
            <p>People who smoke are advised to quit before treatment. Smoking can delay the healing process. Of course, smoking causes numerous oral health problems.</p>
            <p>Any medical conditions affecting your immune system could slow down the healing process. It may not necessarily mean you are unsuitable for dental implants. It is worth inquiring as newer and more advanced techniques are developing. Some can help people who may have been unsuitable for treatment before.</p>
            <p class="span">If you have medical issues, we can talk about the possible risks for implant treatment. For example, diabetes is a condition that can affect healing. People with diabetes may be suitable for treatment when this condition is well controlled.<img src="img/porfile/pin.png" alt=""></p>
            <p>We provide you with all the information you need to make an informed choice about your dental care.</p>
            <h5>What Is the Success Rate of Dental Implants?</h5>
            <p>Dental implants have a <a href="#">high success rate</a>. and your care is in good hands here at LuxDen Dental Center. Dr. Umanoff is highly experienced implant dentist. We use the most advanced techniques to plan and place the best dental implants and to ensure your treatment outcome is successful.</p>
            <p>The risk of infection is low because implants are made from biocompatible materials. They fuse with your jawbone during a process called <a href="#">osseointegration</a> for strong support.</p>
            <h5>What to Expect after Dental Implant Treatment?</h5>
            <p>Once your new tooth is placed, our dedicated dental team will show you how to care for it. Healing is smooth and uneventful. Most people return to everyday activities soon after surgery. Your new implant tooth should feel comfortable and natural. Following the completion of dental implant treatment, we can work with you to ensure you maintain your dental implants.</p>
            <p>It is critical to follow an excellent daily oral care routine. It is recommended to see our dentist regularly for checkups and hygiene appointments. Caring for dental implants isn’t difficult. Good oral hygiene ensures you will enjoy your implant teeth for years or for life.</p>

            <a href="#">Using Only the Highest Quality Dental Implant Components</a>

            <p>We realize that some people prefer <strong>metal-free solutions</strong> or have metal sensitivities. We can provide zirconia dental implants for patients in this position. Zirconia is a strong ceramic material that offers excellent biocompatibility.</p>
